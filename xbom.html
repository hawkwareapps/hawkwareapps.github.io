            XBOM empowers users to build a comprehensive Bill of Materials (BOM) from multiple BOM sources, without 
            incurring the time and expense of implementing a full-blown PLM system. XBOM builds on the flexibility and ease-of-use you already enjoy from SOLIDWORKS PDM, adding new capabilities to combine and reconcile multiple BOM sources into a single, 
            more complete Bill of Materials process. With XBOM it is easy to view, edit, sort & filter your data to print or export only the relevant information, while maintaining full revision and workflow control.
